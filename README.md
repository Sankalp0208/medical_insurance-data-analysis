# 🩺 Medical Insurance Data Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a medical insurance dataset to understand how factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children influence medical insurance charges. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and potential insights that can assist in healthcare cost estimation and policy-making.

<h2>📁 Dataset Information </h2><br>
The dataset typically contains the following columns:<br>

age: Age of the insured person<br>

sex: Gender of the person<br>

bmi: Body Mass Index<br>

children: Number of children covered by insurance<br>

smoker: Whether the person smokes (yes/no)<br>

region: Residential area in the US<br>

charges: Insurance cost billed to the person<br>

<h2>📊 Objectives</h2><br>
Perform data cleaning and handling of missing values<br>

Analyze how each feature affects charges<br>

Visualize distributions and relationships using graphs<br>

Group customers into meaningful categories (e.g., age groups, BMI levels)<br>

Identify key drivers of high medical insurance costs<br>

Create grouped summaries and comparisons (e.g., average charges by smoker status)<br>
